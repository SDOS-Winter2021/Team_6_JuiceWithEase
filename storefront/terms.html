                                Every bottle is extracted fresh and stored hygienically while it is delivered to you. After
taking delivery, refrigerate it immediately, if you plan to consumer later. You are requested to
keep it refrigerated and consume the beverage within 2 hours to gain maximum nutrient value
of the extract. As our juices/beverages are all natural and pulpy, hence the taste may vary
with each bottle of the juice extracted and delivered to the customer. Since it is highly
perishable and pure, BFBPL will not take any guarantee of the juice after it is accepted.<br><br>
We do not use any preservatives or chemicals in our juices and though we are extremely
careful with how we handle produce and the machines that are used for juicing, the fruits and
other ingredients used are outsourced from third parties and such fruits and ingredients may
contain chemicals/preservatives and we do not take any responsibility for the same.<br><br>
BFBPL do not grow its own fruits and vegetables. We buy our fruits and vegetables from the
credible sources and reputable vendors who are either crop aggregator or importers of foreign
fruit produce. We do random product checking to the test the sanctity and quality of the
product/fruit that we buy.<br><br>
Our commitment to serve high-quality fruit and vegetable juice makes us invest regularly in
evaluating and testing the fruit that we buy from our vendors regularly. Any fruit deficiency,
defect, or degenerative condition of the fruit is not in our control. We try our level best to not
to use any fruit which is pale, decomposed or looks default, visibly deformed. We always try
procuring fruits/vegetables on regular basis ensuring the freshness is maintained.<br><br>
We preserve our fruits in an air-tight container and refrigerate them in an air-tight situation.
Our fruits are cut, and clean with RO water. Our fruits are not touched at the time of cut, peel,
and juicing. We wear high-end gloves while chopping, cleaning, and producing the juice.<br><br>
We ensure keeping high-level of cleanliness and quality output in our juicing unit. Hence, ny
fruit degeneration, deformation, decay which is internal to the fruit and not visible is not in
our control.<br><br>

Hence, any claim made for any damage caused due to the liquefied fruit juice will not be a
responsibility of BFBPL. But, we completely empathize with any situation arising and would
deeply investigate the cause. Just make sure that any bottle delivered which is unsealed
should not be received by the customer.<br>
